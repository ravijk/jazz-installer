## Post Installation - Start using Jazz Framework - Create your first service!
Jazz provides management UI to create and manage serverless services.

Post successful Installation, framework is ready to use! Start using [Jazz UI](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-core/wiki/Jazz-UI---Overview) to create your services! Please refer to [Getting Started with Service Development using Serverless](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-core/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Service-Development-using-Serverless).


## Limitations
* Jazz stack will be created in us-east-1 region (we see few permission issues (s3 & cognito) when we use us-east-2 region)
* Only one stack can be created in one region per account (this limitation will be removed in the next version)
