# Jazz Installer (Developer Preview)
## Overview

**Jazz Installer** - Installs [Jazz Serverless Developer Framework in AWS Cloud](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-core/wiki).

**Note** : Please go through [limitations](#limitations) before you proceed.
       Also Make sure [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are met before you proceed with the installation.
       Currently we are supporting the Linux based Installer and Windows based jazz installer is coming soon. 

## Prerequisites
* Create AWS account with permissions/privileges to create the 
  [AWS Resources](#aws-resources) (listed below) in us-east-1 region. 
* Use RHEL 7 instance as your installer box. [How to Launch AWS RHEL7 Instance](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-installer/wiki/Launch-AWS-RHEL7-Instance-for-Installer)


## Installation steps
1) SSH to RHEL 7 instance
2) Run the below command to run the installation Wizard and provide prompted AWS configurations

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmobile/jazz-installer/master/installscripts/terraforminstaller/rhel7Installer.sh?token=AcuYLfUy56QFj_7wyw-tWDapxZV-triUks5ZnYtmwA%3D%3D -o rhel7Installer.sh && chmod +x rhel7Installer.sh && ./rhel7Installer.sh && cd ./jazz-installer/installscripts/wizard && ./run.py 
 ```

3) The installer supports the following installations. Please follow the installation wizard prompts. (The installer will take around 20-30mins (for a AWS RHEL T2.micro instance) to complete.)

     1. [Full Stack Installation](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-installer/wiki/Jazz-Supported-Installations#full-stack-installation)- Creates Network and the rest of the stack.   
     1. [Installation with existing network](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-installer/wiki/Jazz-Supported-Installations#installation-with-existing-network) - Uses existing network to build the stack.     
     1. [Installation with existing Jenkins and Bitbucket servers](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-installer/wiki/Jazz-Supported-Installations#installation-with-existing-jenkins-and-bitbucket-servers) - Uses existing Jenkins and Bitbucket Servers (as provided) to build the stack.


  4) Installation - status
  
     Note: the nohop.out will be in ~/jazz-installer/installscripts/terraform-unix-demo-jazz or for Installation with existing servers in ~/jazz-installer/installscripts/terraform-unix-noinstances-jazz

     A. The installer will take around 20-30mins (for a AWS RHEL T2.micro instance) to complete.
     
       a. To ensure Installation completion, please execute the below statement

              tail -f nohup.out | grep 'Installation Completed!!!'

       b. On Installation completion you would - you should be able to see the below text:

     B. If the installation does not complete in 40 mins or so, please review the nohop.out for any error messages.

## Limitations
* We are creating the stack on us-east-1 region. Because us-east-2 has permission issue with s3 Bucket and Cognito resource is not available in us-west-1 region.
* We have limitation of one stack on a region for an account. (coming soon - this limitation will be removed)
